- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vite bundler

### What I learned

This project I gained a better understand of max-width and widths. Figured out how to incorporate React, alongside it components.
Submitting became a struggle I had trouble when deploying 404 erros fired, turns out it was a simple fix of path. The initial path to the img file couldn't be reached (some nested react hiccup). Eentually I found the answer to move assets/imgage folder into a public folder.

I included variables, used react to further practice my newly learnt knowledge, for styling I continue to gain confidence when setting widths/ max.

### Continued development

I'd like to dive into using grids a bit more I'm not very confident in that are, transitions, or even positioning and of course I think ill be challenging myself to go mobile first reponsiveness next challenge. I'm accostumed to desktop, but the norm has become mobile first.
